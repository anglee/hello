unit-testing angular with karma and jasmine

```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ karma start
```


If using Webstorm, in `karma.conf.js` set autowatch to false. In Webstorm, right click karma.conf.js
to run it.


If not, either set `autowatch` to `true`, and run from command line by
```
$ karma start
```
or for a single run, set `autowatch` to `false`, and `singleRun` to `true`
